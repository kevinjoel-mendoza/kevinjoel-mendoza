Hi, I am Kevin Joel Mendoza. 
I have been an Electronics Engineer since 2017. 
I have worked with various embedded systems such as STM32 and TI, using C. 
I have also done a bit of automated scripting using python and C# during my work.
I am using this github account to document a bit of my skills and to show off my personal projects.

I hope to display all my aforementioned experience using this as well as branching off with ESP32 projects and doing work with RTOS and DSP algorithms and control loops.
